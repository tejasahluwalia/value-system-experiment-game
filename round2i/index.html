        <h2>Round 2 Instructions</h2>
        <p>Now you will continue with the same task, but there will be an additional thing to do.</p>
        <p>Sometimes on some cards, one of the four suits will flash and then disappear. When it's the chance to discard that card, you have to now place the card in either of the four corners based on the suit.</p>
        <p>If you succeed, you will receive additional points based on the value of the card. However, if you choose the wrong corner, the additional value will be subtracted.</p>
        <p>For example, if the suit heart appeared on a card with a value of 9, then if you discard the card correctly (heart corner), you will receive 9 points and if you do it incorrectly (diamond, clubs, spade corners), then 9 points will be subtracted.</p>
        <p>The value of all face cards is 10.</p>
        <p>You can choose to discard the card at top or bottom like usual if you don't remember, but it would lead to a time penalty of 2 seconds.</p>
